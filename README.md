# QTM 350 Project
### Christina Li, Krystal Song
This project aims to study factors determing the systematic risk using PCA. We plan to use high-frequency stock dataset.
## Dataset
We plan to use data from the WRDS TAQ millisecond trades database for this project.
## Project Goal
The goal for this research is to better understand systematic risk and thus make some contributions to asset pricing and portfolio management sectors. 
## Potential Challenges and Solutions
We may encounter challenges in the data collection and cleaning processes, as cleaning high-frequency data is computationally intensive. To solve this problem, we could split the task and search for open-source codes for some insights.
