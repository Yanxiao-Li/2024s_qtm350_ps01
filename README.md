# QTM 350 Project - Systematic Risk Study using PCA
### Christina Li, Krystal Song
This project aims to study factors determing the systematic risk using PCA. We plan to use high-frequency stock dataset.
#### Systematic risk
Systematic risk, often referred to as market risk, is a type of risk that affects an entire financial market or a large portion of it. This risk is inherent to the entire market or market segment, meaning it cannot be eliminated or reduced through diversification of investment portfolio. 
#### PCA
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a statistical technique used in the field of data science and statistics to simplify the complexity in high-dimensional data while retaining trends and patterns. It does this by transforming the original variables into a new set of variables, the principal components, which are orthogonal (uncorrelated), and which capture the maximum amount of variance in the data.
## Dataset
We plan to use data from the WRDS TAQ millisecond trades database for this project.
## Project Goal
The goal for this research is to better understand systematic risk and thus make some contributions to asset pricing and portfolio management sectors. 
## Potential Challenges and Solutions
We may encounter challenges in the data collection and cleaning processes, as cleaning high-frequency data is computationally intensive. To solve this problem, we could split the task and search for open-source codes for some insights.
